# Records Module

This page explains how to use the **#records module** to play maps, record your run, and submit your result.

Before starting:

* Make sure your [recording](../recording.md) software is ready.
* Read the map [rules](../rules.md)

---

## Join the Records Module Room

Enter the module room in **Transformice**:

```text
/room *#records0Username#0000
```

Replace `Username#0000` with your in-game username and tag.

Example:

```text
/room *#records0Player#1234
```

---

## Load a Map

Load your chosen map inside the module room:

```text
!map @7975329
```

You can replace `@7975329` with another map code.

---

## Play and Record Your Run

* Start [recording](../recording.md) before playing the map.
* Play the map and aim for your best possible time.
* You can retry the map as many times as needed.

---

## Submit Your Result

When you are satisfied with your run:

```text
!submit
```

The module will generate a submission hash message starting with:

```text
!submithash
```

📋 **Copy that entire message.**
You will need it to complete your submission.
